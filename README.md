## Why

Being sensitive to detail and being able to take it in are not the same thing, and in order for us to appreciate and respect the difference, we must wonder, how do can we be mindful of those differences for everyone who will interact with our solutions, our designs, our contents, and our message.

So if we consider the typical scenario for developers today, you are likely dealing with markup, code, testing… etc. along with a myriad of opinionated packages and tooling that don't always work as expected.

There is little realization of the problem, but it is not a "personal problem", and it is not just "my disability". It is a "social black hole" that grows with the adoption of tech, and a poor understanding of the manifestations of the mainstream-first design mentality that leads to "artificial disability" piling on top of one's "natural disability".

That while we shifted the accessability of tech to encompass the majority, we did that by displacing new "artificial disability" and we are unable to understand that because "no one action is directly responsible for this".

Now consider the typical scenario for your intended consumers, every last one, and only then can you actually start to see the undue friction you leave behind, when user stories are built for the ideal user and then enhanced to encompass your real ones.

## How

I am still figuring things out, but the abstract philosophy is:

1. Only use things that embody the comprehensive experience philosophy.

2. Use as little things as possible.

3. Never use two things that are actually meant to be the same thing.

4. Never doubt when someone points out something that is not quit a thing in your own frame of reference, but instead, ask questions that will help determine which thing if any this thing really approximates, and if you need a new thing to give them the correct thing.

Now do this for your:

- Assets — ie source and production assets.
- Documentation — ie project and release documents.
- Operations — ie internal and customer threads.

To get this right, you must retrain how you go about estimating time and cost, but in all likelihood, that worry that it takes more, that is just your blindsight to all the loss you incur when you leave behind exponential work that someone else somewhere at one point in time will have to try to hack somehow, or think they did.
