Collective rethinking of documents that drive our collective efforts.

</div>

## Overview

The idea is to start an effort for various 101 docs and create variations that are suited to different reading styles and preferences, not unlike i18n, but which are frictionless and/or accessible!

For starters, folks could write the missing README files for how to use GitHub… etc, then move on to other documents in our shared knowledge base, for the open source collective.

_`it's like collective i18n effort… to some extent!`_

</p></div>

Doing that will likely be the missing agent that will finally help close the gaps between the various frames of reference, and that will make it possible to reason about the unknown expanse that leaves all of us unsure where to begin.

### Motivating Examples

- You can look at those two great examples by the [Autistic Self Advocacy Network](autisticadvocacy.org):

  1. [Inclusive Meetings - Plain Language](https://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/PL-Inclusive-Meetings.pdf)
  2. [Inclusive Meetings - Easy Read](https://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/er-inclusive-meetings.pdf)

  The point though, those are merely two of any number of interpolations that will suite readers of some shared difference(s).

Opting for a more frictionless style of communication does not mean we need to stop using bad tools and start using good ones, only to adopt that mindset when we use tools, and then we can decide if we need more adaptable ones.

Here are examples of things some of us did with the usual tools that were meant to make them more frictionless:
